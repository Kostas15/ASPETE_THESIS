# ASPETE_THESIS by Konstantinos Fasouras
In the file aspete_thesis_all.m you will find the code that represents my final thesis regarding the selection of OBD2 dataset and processing using Machine Learning techniques. We managed to implement it using Matlab and its variety of tools. 

The code does training on the 80% on each car, and on line 51 we chose which car will be put through testing, where we will extract 100 samples from the remining of 20% from the selected car. In the command window a message will apear displaying the success rate of finding the selected car.

The remaining files contain the information of every car in a seperate file, after they have been put through cleaning mechanisms in order for the data to be complete.
